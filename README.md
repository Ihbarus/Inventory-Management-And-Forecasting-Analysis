# Inventory-Management-And-Forecasting-Analysis

This project focuses on effective inventory planning and decision-making for Canon consumables using structured inventory classification, seasonal demand forecasting, and procurement optimization techniques. 
The goal is to simulate real-world decision-making in operations using tools such as Excel and SPSS.

🧠 Key Objectives

1. Classify items using ABC Analysis based on annual usage value
2. Forecast monthly demand using the Simple Seasonal Model
3. Optimize ordering using EOQ and Wagner-Whitin Dynamic Lot Sizing
4. Visualize inventory insights and decisions clearly for management use


🔧 Tools & Platforms

1. Microsoft Excel – Core analysis, visualization, and modeling
2. IBM SPSS – Time series forecasting using Simple Seasonal method
3. Python (light use) – Used only to generate simulated inventory datasets


📊 Techniques Applied

Inventory Control ==>	ABC Classification
Forecasting ==>	Simple Seasonal Forecasting (SPSS) and Decomposition
Procurement ==>	EOQ Model & Wagner-Whitin Algorithm
Visualization	==> Charts and dashboards in Excel


📌 Highlights

1. Class A items (top ~10%) accounted for nearly 60–70% of the total inventory value, justifying tighter control
2. Forecasting revealed clear seasonal spikes from November to February, supporting proactive ordering
3. EOQ and Wagner-Whitin models were used to optimize order quantity and timing, reducing total procurement cost
4. Visual dashboards and charts were created in Excel to support management decision-making
